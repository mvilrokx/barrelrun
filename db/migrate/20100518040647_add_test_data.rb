#                        The 2008 Far Niente Chardonnay greets with aromas 
#                        of ripe melon, fig and peach. A creamy and smooth 
#                        entry leads to a rich midpalate, layered with ripe 
#                        tropical fruit and toasted hazelnuts. The finish is 
#                        long and mouthwatering with well-integrated toast 
#                        and spice.
